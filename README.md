**Viterbi and ForwardBackward algorithms for Symmetric Continuous-time Markov-Chain HMM**

The package contains two main algorithms for generic Continuous-time Markov Chain hidden Markov Models

1) Implementation of ForwardBackward Algorithm on a Symmetric Continuous-time Markov Chain HMM:

Implementing the ForwardBackward algorithm,given likelihood of observed data,timestamp of each observation and a parameter theta.

2) Implementation of Viterbi Algorithm on a Symmetric Continuous-time Markov Chain HMM using Rcpp:
 Function that implements a Viterbi algorithm, given likelihood of observed data,timestamp of each observation and a parameter theta.
